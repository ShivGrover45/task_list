# 📝 Task List API

A simple Task List backend API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** for database modeling. This project allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks — a clean introduction to building REST APIs with MongoDB.

## 🚀 Features

* Add new tasks
* Fetch all tasks
* Mark tasks as complete
* Delete tasks
* Uses MongoDB as the database
* Follows a simple MVC structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) for development

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivGrover45/task_list.git
   cd task_list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start your MongoDB server**

   Make sure MongoDB is running locally on `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

4. **Run the server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server should now be running at:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

| PUT    | `/tasks/:id` | Mark task as completed  |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id` | Delete a task           |

### 📌 Example Task Object

```json
